# CFD-SIMULATOR

A 2D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solver for NACA airfoil sections, with an
interactive viewer.

**Status: Phase 0 — project foundation. No CFD is implemented.**

What exists today is the scaffolding a solver will be built on: a modular
CMake build, a core library providing logging and value-based error handling, a
tested world/screen camera transform, a test suite, and a desktop application
shell with an empty coordinate viewport. There is no geometry, no mesh, no
discretisation and no flow solution yet. Nothing in this repository has been
validated against experimental or reference CFD data, because there is nothing
yet to validate.

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Compiler | C++20 (tested with Apple Clang 17) |
| Build system | CMake ≥ 3.24 |
| Graphics | OpenGL 3.2 core profile |

Third-party dependencies are downloaded automatically at configure time and
pinned by SHA-256; no package manager is required. An internet connection is
needed for the first configure only.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Useful options:

```sh
# Headless: core library and tests only, no window system needed.
cmake -S . -B build -DCFD_BUILD_APP=OFF

# Treat compiler warnings as errors (recommended before committing).
cmake -S . -B build -DCFD_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CFD_BUILD_APP` | `ON` | Build the GUI shell and the `cfd_sim` executable |
| `CFD_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Build the unit test suite |
| `CFD_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` | `OFF` | Add `-Werror` to first-party targets |

The default build type for single-config generators is `RelWithDebInfo`.

## Test

```sh
ctest --test-dir build
```

Add `--output-on-failure` to see diagnostics from failing tests.

## Run

```sh
./build/bin/cfd_sim
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage summary |
| `-V`, `--version` | Version, build type, compiler |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `critical`, `off` |
| `--self-check` | Headless subsystem check, then exit (this is what CTest runs) |
| `--screenshot FILE` | Render a few frames, save the window as a BMP, exit |

### Viewport controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left or middle drag | Pan |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom about the cursor |
| `F` | Reset view |

Panel dividers are draggable; panels can be toggled from the **View** menu.

```

### Module boundaries

`cfd_core` depends on nothing but the standard library. `cfd_app` is the only
module that knows GLFW, OpenGL or Dear ImGui exist. Solver code added in later
phases will sit on top of `cfd_core` and stay independent of the GUI, so the
numerics remain buildable and testable on a machine with no display — which is
what `-DCFD_BUILD_APP=OFF` verifies.

## Dependencies

| Library | Version | Role | Fetched |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) | 1.92.9b | Immediate-mode GUI | configure time |
| [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) | 3.5.1 | Window, OpenGL context, input | configure time |
| [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) | 1.17.0 | Unit tests | configure time |
| OpenGL | 3.2 core | Rendering | system |

Each is pinned to a release tarball plus a SHA-256 hash, so a configure either
reproduces the exact same sources or fails loudly.

## Roadmap

Phase 0 is complete. Later phases build on it in order:

1. NACA 4-digit geometry generation
2. Mesh generation around the section
3. Navier-Stokes discretisation
4. Reynolds averaging (RANS)
5. k-ω SST turbulence closure
6. Force and moment integration (lift, drag, moment coefficients)
7. Boundary-layer separation detection
8. Vortex structures and stall behaviour

## Documentation

[`JOURNAL.md`](JOURNAL.md) is a technical journal explaining what each phase
implements, why it is built that way, and the concepts behind it.
